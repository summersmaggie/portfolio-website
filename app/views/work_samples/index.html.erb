      <h4>Programming</h4>
      <p>I recently graduated from Epicodus after training for 20 weeks to become a full stack developer. I became skilled in CSS/HTML, JavaScript/Angular, and Ruby/Rails. It was a transformative 20 weeks, and more than anything, I learned how to think like a developer. Best of all, I learned how to create things for the web... like this website, which I built on Rails.</p>

      <h4>Social Media</h4>
      <p> I worked in social media for 5 years before pivoting to programming. At fast-paced, client-centric agencies, my roles ranged from social media manager to strategist to community manager.</p>
